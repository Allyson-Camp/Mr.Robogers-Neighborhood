## Description
This webpage allows a user to input a number of their choosing and be returned a list of values from 0 up to the users designated number, with some substitutions:
  - Entries containing 1 in them are replaced with the word "Beep!"
  - Entries containing 2 in them are replaced with "Boop!"
  - Entries containing 3 are replaced with "Won't you be my neighbor?"
  - In numbers containing both: the higher number is what takes presedence and is called as the substitution
To achieve this, array methods, looping, and branching logic were all applied in the programs JS.
